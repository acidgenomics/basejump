  The basejump package is an infrastructure toolkit that extends the base
  functionality of Bioconductor [@Huber2015-nw]. The package leverages the S4
  object system for object-oriented programming, and defines multiple additional
  generic functions for use in genomics research. basejump provides simple,
  user-friendly functions for the acquisition of genome annotations from
  multiple online databases, including native support for Ensembl
  [@Hubbard2002-ah] and websites supporting standard FASTA and GTF/GFF file
  formats. Consistent handling of sample metadata remains a challenge for many
  bioinformatic analyses, and basejump aims to address this by providing a suite
  of sanitization functions to help standardize these variable inputs.
  Additionally, interactive read/write operations in R can be cumbersome and
  non-trivial when working with multiple data objects; here we provide
  additional functions designed for interactive use that aim to reduce friction
  and provide consistent handling of multiple common file formats used in
  genomics research.

# Introduction

This vignette focuses on the most common user-facing functions that fall into the following categories:

- Annotation functions
- Read/write functions
- Data functions
- Plot functions
- Sanitization functions
- Math and science functions

There are additional function families whose functionality lie outside the scope of this vignette. Consult the [basejump][] website or package documentation for more information of these types of functions, which are more technical in nature and predominantly developer-facing:

- R Markdown functions.
- Atomic vector functions.
- Coercion methods.
- Developer functions.
- Assert check functions.

# The S4 object system

The [basejump][] package defines generics and methods for object-oriented programming with the S4 object system, which is used extensively by the [Bioconductor][] project. These resources describe the S4 object system in detail:

- [S4 classes and methods](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/Zurich/S4-classes-and-methods.html), Martin Morgan and Hervé Pagès, 2017.
- [A quick overview of the S4 class system](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/S4Vectors/inst/doc/S4QuickOverview.pdf), Hervé Pagès, 2016.
- [The S4 object system](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html), Hadley Wickham.
- [Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science](http://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor), Kasper Hansen, 2016.
- [S4 System Development in Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2010/AdvancedR/S4InBioconductor.pdf), Patrick Aboyoun, 2010.

Here's the current list of S4 generics exported by the package:

```{r, include=FALSE}
generics <- getGenerics(asNamespace("basejump"))
links <- paste0("`", slot(generics, ".Data"), "()`")
markdownList(links)
```

In [R][], you can check whether a function is using the S4 object system with the `base::isS4()` function. Additionally, `methods::showMethods()` and `methods::getMethod()`. In contrast, to obtain information on functions using the [S3][] object system, use `utils::methods()` instead.

# Annotation functions

Obtaining versioned genome annotations quickly and reliably from online databases such as [Ensembl][] [@Hubbard2002-ah], [GENCODE][] [@Harrow2012-hx], [RefSeq][] [@Pruitt2007-vu], and the [UCSC Genome Browser][UCSC] [@Kent2002-fo] remains overly challenging. [basejump][] aims to help address this issue by providing native gene- and transcript-level annotation support by helping users interface with [AnnotationHub][] and [ensembldb][], along with a robust set of tools to parse [GTF][] and [GFF][] annotation files. Annotation file parsing is handled internally by the [rtracklayer][] package [@Lawrence2009-zx]. Genome annotations are returned as `GRanges` objects, defined in the [GenomicRanges][] package [@Lawrence2013-vz], which allows for easy access to position, chromosome, strand, and additional metadata saved in the `mcols` slot of the object. `GRanges` can be coerced to a standard `data.frame` using the `BiocGenerics::as.data.frame()` function.

## Ensembl annotations

`makeGRangesFromEnsembl()` supports multiple genome builds, and versioned releases from [Ensembl][].

### Current release

By default, the function will use the latest release version available from [AnnotationHub][] and [ensembldb][].

```{r}
grch38 <- makeGRangesFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens")
summary(grch38)
head(names(grch38))
names(metadata(grch38))
```

Data inside a `GRanges` object can be accessed with a number of functions defined in the [GenomeInfoDb][] package.

```{r}
GenomeInfoDb::seqnames(grch38)
GenomeInfoDb::seqinfo(grch38)
IRanges::ranges(grch38)
BiocGenerics::strand(grch38)
```

The `GRanges` class is a powerful container for genomic coordinates and metadata. For example, we can easily the gene counts per chromosome.

```{r}
grch38 %>%
    GenomeInfoDb::seqnames(.) %>%
    table() %>%
    sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
    head(n = 24) %>%
    .[sort(names(.))]
```

Gene metadata is contained in the `mcols` slot of the object, using a `DataFrame` internally. Here'a the current list of gene-level annotation columns returned from `makeGRangesFromEnsembl()`:

```{r}
S4Vectors::mcols(grch38) %>% colnames()
S4Vectors::mcols(grch38) %>% lapply(., head)
```

Transcript-level annotations are also supported, using the `level = "transcripts"` argument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
transcripts <- makeGRangesFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens", level = "transcripts")
```

### Versioned releases

Versioned releases are supported by the "`release`" argument, which currently supports back to [Ensembl][] 87. If an older [Ensembl][] release is required, resort to using a [GTF][]/[GFF][] file or browse the [Bioconductor][] website to see if a suitable annotation database package is available.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
grch38_90 <- makeGRangesFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens", release = 90)
```

### GRCh37

The legacy [Ensembl GRCh37 genome build][GRCh37] (release 75; also known as [UCSC hg19][hg19]) is also supported, but is no longer recommended for use in new analyses. Internally, support for [GRCh37][] is provided by the [EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75][] annotation database package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
grch37 <- makeGRangesFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens", build = "GRCh37")
```

## Gene mapping functions

Gene-to-symbol and transcript-to-gene mappings can be easily acquired with the `gene2symbol()` and `tx2gene()` functions. Both of these functions return a `data.frame`.

```{r}
gene2symbol <- makeGene2SymbolFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens")
print(gene2symbol)
```

```{r}
tx2gene <- makeTx2GeneFromEnsembl("Homo sapiens")
print(tx2gene)
```

## Parse GTF/GFF files

For organisms that are not well supported on [Ensembl][], we recommend using [GTF][] or [GFF][] files for gene annotations. In general, [GTF][] files are more consistently standardized and recommended over GFF3, if possible. `makeTx2geneFromGFF()` and `makeGene2symbolFromGFF()` are utility functions that can return transcript-to-gene and gene-to-symbol mappings from the genomic ranges returned by `makeGRangesFromGFF()`.

### GTF

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gtf_file <- paste(
    "ftp://ftp.ensembl.org",
    "pub",
    "release-92",
    "gtf",
    "homo_sapiens",
    "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.92.gtf.gz",
    sep = "/"
)
grch38_92 <- makeGRangesFromGFF(gtf_file)
```

### GFF3

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gff_file <- paste(
    "ftp://ftp.ensembl.org",
    "pub",
    "release-92",
    "gff3",
    "homo_sapiens",
    "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.92.gff3.gz",
    sep = "/"
)
grch38_92 <- makeGRangesFromGFF(gff_file)
```

## Gene interconversion functions

Dealing with gene identifier to gene name (symbol) mapping in a non-destructive manner remains challenging for the bioinformatics community. [basejump][] provides `convertGenesToSymbols()` and `convertSymbolsToGenes()` generics that define methods for `SummarizedExperiment`, making interconversion between gene IDs and gene names easier. Internally, these mappings are handled by the `geneID` and `geneName` `mcols` columns inside of the `rowRanges` slot.

```{r}
rse_symbols <- convertGenesToSymbols(rse_small)
head(rownames(rse_symbols))
```

```{r}
rse_genes <- convertSymbolsToGenes(rse_symbols)
head(rownames(rse_genes))
```

To convert from transcript- to gene-level easily, the `convertTranscriptsToGenes()` and `stripTranscriptVersions()` functions are also provided (not shown).

## Query external annotation databases

In addition to interfacing with [Ensembl][], [basejump][] exports a number of utility functions to interface with other genomic databases, including:

- [EggNOG][] [@Huerta-Cepas2016-ql].
- [HGNC][] [@Yates2017-fq].
- [MGI][] [@Smith2018-ds].
- [PANTHER][] [@Mi2017-jl].

### HGNC

```{r}
hgnc2gene <- HGNC2Ensembl()
summary(hgnc2gene)
```

### MGI

```{r}
mgi2ensembl <- MGI2Ensembl()
summary(mgi2ensembl)
```

### EggNOG

```{r}
eggnog <- EggNOG()
summary(eggnog)
```

### PANTHER

```{r}
panther <- PANTHER(organism = "Homo sapiens")
summary(panther)
```

### WormBase

Note that for *Caenorhabditis elegans* genome annotations, we recommend additional use of our specialized [wormbase package][r-wormbase], which queries the [WormBase][] database [@Stein2001-mk] directly, and provides support of versioned releases (e.g. WS265) that have additional metadata not currently available on [Ensembl][].

# Plot functions

## ggplot2 themes

The package provides two simple, high-contrast [ggplot2][] [@Wickham2009-si] themes that are suitable for publication and presentation. Both of these themes extend the `ggplot2::theme_bw()` theme, with a few tweaks. `theme_paperwhite()` uses black on white colors, and `theme_midnight()` is a dark theme, instead opting for white on black. Both themes use bold sans serif fonts for all labels, and remove the axis grid by default, which are typically not very informative and make a plot appear more cluttered.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
p <- ggplot(
    data = mpg,
    mapping = aes(
        x = manufacturer,
        y = displ,
        colour = manufacturer
    )
) +
    geom_point()
```

For reference, here are two popular [ggplot2][] default themes: `theme_grey()` and `theme_bw()`.

```{r}
p + theme_grey()
p + theme_bw()
```

The basejump themes extend `theme_bw()`, with a few tweaks and color changes.

```{r}
p + theme_paperwhite()
p + theme_midnight()
```

## Heatmaps

Additional, the package provides support for easy heatmap generation, by wrapping the popular [pheatmap][] package. Here are providing `SummarizedExperiment` method support, so annotation column metadata is handled seamlessly.

```{r}
plotHeatmap(rse_small)
plotCorrelationHeatmap(rse_small)
plotQuantileHeatmap(rse_small)
```

# Sanitization functions

The `makeNames` suite of function, consisting primarily of `camel()`, `dotted()`, `snake()`, and `upperCamel()`, provide S4 method support for sanitizing common data structures used in genomics research and on [Bioconductor][].

To see how these functions work, let's load up an example `list` named `mn` (short for `makeNames`).

```{r}
url <- file.path(basejumpCacheURL, "mn.rda")
loadRemoteData(url)
```

## Atomic vectors

### Character

```{r}
x <- mn$character
print(x)
camel(x)
dotted(x)
snake(x)
upperCamel(x)
makeNames(x)
```

### Named character

```{r}
x <- mn$namedCharacter
print(x)
camel(x)
dotted(x)
snake(x)
upperCamel(x)
makeNames(x)
```

### Factor

```{r}
x <- mn$factor
print(x)
camel(x)
dotted(x)
snake(x)
upperCamel(x)
makeNames(x)
```

## Data frames

```{r}
x <- datasets::USArrests
dimnames(x)
camel(x, rownames = TRUE, colnames = TRUE) %>% dimnames()
dotted(x, rownames = TRUE, colnames = TRUE) %>% dimnames()
snake(x, rownames = TRUE, colnames = TRUE) %>% dimnames()
upperCamel(x, rownames = TRUE, colnames = TRUE) %>% dimnames()
```

## Lists

```{r}
x <- mn$list
print(x)
camel(x) %>% names()
dotted(x) %>% names()
snake(x) %>% names()
upperCamel(x) %>% names()
```

# Math and science functions
