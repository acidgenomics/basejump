\usage{
aggregateFeatures(object, ...)

\S4method{aggregateFeatures}{dgCMatrix}(object, groupings)

\S4method{aggregateFeatures}{matrix}(object, groupings)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\item{groupings}{Feature groupings (e.g. gene or transcript IDs), defined as
a named factor. The pooled features must be defined as the factor levels,
and the original features as the names of the factor.}
}
\value{
Object of same class with aggregated features (rows).
