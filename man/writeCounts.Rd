\description{
Supports both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq output. Bulk RNA-seq counts are
written to disk as comma separated values (\code{.csv). Single-cell RNA-seq counts are written to disk in MatrixMarket format (}.mtx\code{), along with the sample barcodes (}.colnames\code{), and gene identifiers (}.rownames`).
}
\details{
Automatic gzip compression is offered as a user-defined option. This setting
is enabled by default to save disk space. Note that the
\href{http://readr.tidyverse.org/}{readr} package, built into
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}, now natively supports compressed files.
